necessary components for HLD of twitter.

User Interface (UI): The front-end of Twitter where users can interact with the platform by creating tweets,
                     following other users, and more. The UI would include elements such as the timeline, profile page,
                     and tweet composition page.

Server: The back-end of the platform that provides the processing power, data storage, and APIs necessary to deliver the Twitter experience. 
         The server would likely include multiple servers for processing, database storage, and caching.

Database: The database is where all of the tweets, user information, and other data generated by the Twitter platform is stored. 
           The database would likely be implemented using a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

APIs: Twitter provides APIs that allow developers to access its data and build applications on top of its platform.
        The APIs would include endpoints for accessing tweets, user information, and other platform data.

Authentication and Authorization: To ensure that only authorized users can access certain resources and perform certain actions,
                                   Twitter would include a system for authentication and authorization. This system would manage 
                                the creation and maintenance of user accounts and ensure that users are properly authenticated when accessing the platform.

Message Broker: To support the real-time delivery of tweets and other updates to users, Twitter would likely use a message broker such as Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.
               The message broker would provide a scalable and efficient way to distribute updates to the server infrastructure and ultimately to the user's device.

Caching Layer: To improve performance and reduce the load on the database, Twitter would likely include a caching layer that temporarily stores data in memory. 
                 This would allow the platform to quickly serve frequently requested data without having to retrieve it from the database.
